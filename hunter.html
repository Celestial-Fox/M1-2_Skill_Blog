        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            In Monster Hunter,
            you take on the role of a hunter tasked with tracking and slaying massive,
            powerful monsters in diverse environments.
            The gameplay focuses on strategic combat,
            where you choose from a variety of weapons‚Äîeach with unique playstyles‚Äîand learn monster patterns to exploit weaknesses.
            After defeating monsters,
            you gather materials to craft better armor and weapons,
            which help you take on even bigger and more dangerous creatures.
            It‚Äôs a cycle of hunting, upgrading,
            and mastering your skills,
            all while exploring rich ecosystems filled with life and challenges.
        </p>
        <h2>The world itself</h2>
        <p>
            The world of Monster Hunter is a vast and diverse ecosystem teeming with life,
            from towering ancient forests and scorching deserts to frozen tundras and mysterious coral highlands.
            Each environment is intricately designed, with unique landscapes,
            weather conditions,
            and flora and fauna that all interact naturally.
            Monsters roam these regions,
            acting as apex predators within their habitats,
            and often clash with one another,
            creating dynamic encounters.

            Beyond the monsters,
            the world is alive with details‚Äîrivers, caves, cliffs,
            and hidden paths, encouraging exploration. As a hunter,
            you not only track monsters through these environments but also gather materials,
            set traps, and adapt to the changing landscapes.
            Every area feels rich with history and life,
            making each expedition as much about discovery as it is about the hunt.
