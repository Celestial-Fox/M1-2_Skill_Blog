        <h2>The world itself</h2>
        <p>
            The world of Hollow Knight,
            known as Hallownest,
            is a sprawling,
            atmospheric kingdom hidden deep beneath the surface.
            It's a beautifully decayed realm,
            filled with diverse environments ranging from lush, green caverns to dark,
            foreboding depths.
            Each area has its own distinct atmosphere,
            from the eerie stillness of the Forgotten Crossroads to the vibrant yet deadly Greenpath and the haunting beauty of the City of Tears,
            where rain eternally falls.

        <h2>Lore</h2>
        <p>
            The lore of Hollow Knight is centered around the ancient kingdom of Hallownest,
            a once-prosperous civilization of insect-like beings,
            now fallen into ruin. At the heart of Hallownest‚Äôs decline is an infection known as the Radiance,
            a powerful, ancient being who once ruled over the minds of the inhabitants.
            To stop her, the Pale King, ruler of Hallownest,
            created vessels‚Äîhollow beings born without will or emotion‚Äîdesigned to contain the Radiance‚Äôs power.
            The strongest of these vessels,
            known as the Hollow Knight,
            was sealed away in the Black Egg Temple to keep the infection at bay.
            <br><br>
            However,
            over time,
            cracks formed in the seal,
            allowing the infection to spread across the kingdom once again,
            driving many of its creatures to madness.
            As the nameless Knight,
            the player embarks on a journey through the decaying kingdom,
            uncovering the tragic fates of its inhabitants and the immense sacrifices made to protect Hallownest.
            Along the way,
            the player learns about the ancient conflict between the Pale King and the Radiance,
            the creation of the vessels, and the cost of the kingdom‚Äôs preservation.
            The Knight‚Äôs journey ultimately leads to a confrontation with the infection,
            with multiple possible endings depending on the player‚Äôs choices.
